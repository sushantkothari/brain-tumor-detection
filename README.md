# Brain Tumor Detection

This project focuses on the detection of brain tumors using machine learning techniques. It aims to accurately classify brain MRI images as either containing a tumor or being tumor-free.

## Overview

The detection of brain tumors is crucial for early diagnosis and treatment planning. Traditional methods often rely on manual inspection by radiologists, which can be time-consuming and subject to human error. Machine learning algorithms offer the potential to automate this process and improve accuracy.

This project leverages a dataset of brain MRI images to train a machine learning model for tumor detection. The model is trained on labeled images to learn patterns indicative of tumors. Once trained, it can classify new MRI images as either containing a tumor or not.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of brain MRI images, including both tumor and non-tumor cases. Each image is labeled to indicate the presence or absence of a tumor. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

## Model

The machine learning model employed for brain tumor detection is built using [insert framework/library]. It utilizes [insert algorithm/model] for classification. The model architecture and parameters are optimized to achieve the best performance in terms of accuracy and robustness.

## Usage

To run the brain tumor detection system:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. [Insert instructions for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation].
4. [Insert instructions for running inference on new MRI images].

## Results

[Insert summary of model performance and evaluation results].

## Future Work

Potential improvements and future directions for this project include:

- Fine-tuning the model architecture for better performance.
